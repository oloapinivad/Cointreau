	    <b><i>Disclaimer: this is a scientific excercise, do not take it too seriously. The non-linear model to forecast the evolution is reliable only after one third of its path (Winsor, PNAS, 1932). Hence errors are likely larger than currently estimated in situation where the outbreak is just started. FORECASTS SHOWING "NA" IN THEIR ESTIMATE ARE NOT RELIABLE. Please note that every time new data are added, the fit are adjusted.</i></b>

      <font size="3" > <i>Methodology note: forecasts are estimated with Gompertz functions computed via the nls.lm R function. Ribbons show the 95% confidence interval computed with the confint2 R function. Saturation values are the alpha parameter of the Gompertz fit. Errors are estimated using the half of the distance between the 2.5% and the 97.5% percentiles. When forecasts error is larger than the forecast value, i.e. the forecast is completely unreliable, NA is shown. Forecasts are updated every hour.  Some inconsistencies in Italian prediction may arise from slight data differences between the Civil Protection and the Johns Hopkins archives. The code can be found on <a href=https://github.com/oloapinivad/Cointreau >my GitHub repository</a>, althought it is really badly written. </i> </font>
